# USC Annenberg Journalism Grad Student HTML Template
Hello! This is the template package for graduate students in the MS journalism program at the USC Annenberg School for Journalism. It is a fully responsive HTML5 template, with CSS and some jQuery scripts included.

This can be turned into a multiple-page HTML site, or used as just a single page. You may add on your own styles and scripts as necessary. Further documentation is included in the TemplateDocumentation.pdf file in this package.

Enjoy!
